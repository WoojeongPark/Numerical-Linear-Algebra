% The LURP package has efficient Fortran code to compute
% LU factorizations of dense, unsymmetric matrices using
% Gaussian elimination with rook pivoting. Also the package 
% includes a MATLAB mex interface so that the routines
% can be called directly from MATLAB as well as MATLAB
% code to install and test the package.
%
% The LURP package was created by L. Foster, Department of
% Mathematics, San Jose State University. 7-31-2012, copr.
